# This is an angular project it was supposed to slowly but surely be changed into my own personal portfolio website (I tried it too) but for some reason I never was comfortable with this... and after I actually finished the UI and design and what not I found out why I never managed to like it... cause no matter what I did it wouldnt look like the figma file... because my inexperienced dumb *** chose a figma file that was made by another inexperienced person and it didnt match any screen size... this project did help me get comfy with figma files and taught me TailWindCss so I cant complain. This project is never getting anywhere tho.
